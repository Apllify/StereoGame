# StereoGame

A lightweight game engine based on the open source framework [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/), 
which itself is a remaster of the [XNA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/xna/bb200104(v=xnagamestudio.41)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) framework by Microsoft.

My aim with this project is to provide a compromise between the high level interface of Unity and 
the lower level programming of Monogame. 

The end result is a framework which doesn't require
the user to reinvent the wheel at every step (as Monogame so often does), while still being 
a great way to learn about the fundamental mechanisms behind every modern game.  

# Main Features 
- Virtual resolution support, a must-have for games with a pixelized or retro aesthetic.  
- Built-in collision detection between squares, circles, and all convex shapes.
- A flexible entity system, which provides a very object-oriented way to create game elements.
- Simple UI tools like auto-wrapping text displays and event-based buttons, to easily create menus.
- Easy-to-use particle system, with intuitive tools that can create anything from a simple explosion effect,
  to a complex character trail.
  
And many new features that are still in development. (see [roadmap](#roadmap))

# Roadmap  
Currently, StereoGame does not support, but has plans to add : 
+ A more fleshed-out UI System (Progress Bars, Sliders, etc...).
+ Concave shape collisions.
+ Out-of-the-box support for common algorithms (Pathfinding, Raycast Detection, etc...) 

# Open Source
Any and all contributions to the project are welcome, and I will do my best to 
respond to reports within a timely manner.
